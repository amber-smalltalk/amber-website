  <dl>
    <dt>So...What is it about again?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Amber is a language (derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>) and environment built for the web.</p>
With Amber, client-side web development finally gets the power and productivity that exists in other Smalltalk dialects.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Why should I care?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Having a true live & incremental development environment where you can build your application interactively in the browser is unbeatable.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Why a Smalltalk dialect?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Smalltalk stands head and shoulders above most other languages for clarity, conciseness, and human-friendliness.</p>
      <p>As a language, it is immensely clean and mature, both syntactically and semantically. It is a pure OO language, with objects all the way down.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>But what about all the JS ecosystem?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Amber plays very well with the outer world. You can interact with JavaScript objects seamlessly, and even inspect them as any Amber object.</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/amber-smalltalk/amber/wiki/From-smalltalk-to-javascript-and-back">Evaluating JavaScript object methods</a> is transparent and makes using libraries a breeze.</p>
